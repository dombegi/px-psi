The PSI-26 conference was held in Marsaille, France on 12-17 May 2024. I gave a poster presentation about the in-vessel arc traces investigation of W7-X after OP2.1, in collaboration with IPP Greifswald.

Marsaille was very nice, and I also participated in the PSI football match, which has been 5 years since the last match was in 2018 in Princeton, USA.
